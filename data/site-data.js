          <h2>Skyhawk Composite Squadron, Delano, Minnesota</h2>
          <p>The Skyhawk Composite Squadron was chartered in December of 2020 and has a complement of over 50 members, comprised of cadets age 12-20 and senior members age 18 and above. We are one of <a href="https://mnwg.cap.gov/unit-locations/" target="_blank">24 squadrons</a><a href="https://mnwg.cap.gov/unit-locations/" target="_blank"> that make up the Minnesota Wing</a>.&nbsp;<em>(This link&nbsp;will open a new browser&nbsp;window&nbsp;outside the skyhawk.cap.gov domain.)</em></p>
          <p>Our squadron is dedicated to educating our members about aerospace, emergency services, and leadership; giving them skills that they can apply to their everyday lives.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Through their training, our cadets and senior members develop into mentors that can pass on what they have learned so that members coming in behind them may grow and become leaders.</p>
          <p>As a Squadron, we strive to continue to learn and grow so that we can continue to serve our community and train the leaders of tomorrow.</p>
